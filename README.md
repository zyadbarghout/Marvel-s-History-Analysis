# Marvel's History Analysis
Maybe you are a superhero fan maybe you are not but either way lately you have witnessed great success in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU)
It was obvious that they 

So, One day I had a question
* When did Marvel become this GOOD? and HOW? 
So, I did what any data nerd would do, I searched for and analyzed some of Marvel’s data that helped them adapt and change their strategy over the years since the 40s.
I am very excited to share the data with you, keep an eye on the visuals to get the whole picture. 

Is it all about male characters?

That was a question asked repeatedly during the 60s.  This genre was perceived to be specified or reserved for males only. 
As we can see represented in the data below, the presence of female characters increased over time. 
Starting from the 60s Marvel characters included a larger number of female characters in their production and never went below 20% again.

Who doesn't like the secret characters and the adrenaline that comes with every scene?

Marvel started to concentrate more on the identity of their characters and what the audience liked more. That is exactly what Marvel realized. 
The thrill, the rush and the mystery! behind the secret characters whether bad or good characters this was always a factor that increased the fans engagement. 
As a result, secret characters in Marvel’s production started to increase noticeably during the 70s and 80s. 

Do characters have to be bad or good ?

Marvel was all about presenting two main characters, good and bad. A very small percentage are neutral characters. During the 50s, Marvel decided to increase the percentage of neutral characters by almost double.

The percentage kept on increasing throughout the years to reach 23% of all marvel characters or even more after being at just 4% in the 40s.
This pump was really noticed after the 70s decade and the neutral characters percentage continued to increase against especially the bad characters percentages which declined from 61% at the 40s to  35-43% at the latest in the last decade 

Marvel realized throughout the years the importance of data analysis and how they could use it perfectly to help them achieve more and reach the people better. Data and Data Analysis plays a huge role in the decision making process in big companies such as Marvel and nowadays, Data analysis is what makes great companies GREAT!
